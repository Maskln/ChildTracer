# Child Tracer iOS Application

## Short Description:

	Child Tracer is an mobile app which helps every parent to be calm and in ease when their kid is at school or simply is not home. Every time when the device's battery is critically low (you decide at which point actually), the app awakes and notifies you via email containing the current location of you child including the date and the time. 
	It also sends you an SMS which notifies you that the battery is low in order to ensure that you have received an announcement even if the device has no connection to the Internet. 
	That way you will always be updated on the approximate coordinates of your kid and know that nothing wrong is going to happen to them.
		
		* Bullets of functionalities:
		 * Pin that ensures that your kid has no access to the app settings
		 * Set email and phone number manually or choose them by the phonebook
		 * Set the battery level according to which the device sends you notification
		 * The app runs silently in background mode so that your kid would not even know that it tracks it
